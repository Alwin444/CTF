Using Wireshark in CTFs is primarily about traffic analysis — inspecting captured packets (usually a .pcap file) to extract credentials, hidden strings, or encoded flags.

general method: inspect all tcp pack and find any hints.



1️⃣ What You Usually Get in a CTF

A .pcap or .pcapng file

Or live network traffic

Or a challenge description like:

“Find the flag hidden in network traffic”

Your objective: extract readable or encoded data from packets.

2️⃣ Open the Capture

Open Wireshark

File → Open → challenge.pcap

Immediately check:

Statistics → Protocol Hierarchy

See which protocols are used (HTTP? FTP? DNS? TCP?)

This gives direction.

3️⃣ Most Common CTF Flag Locations
Protocol	Where Flag is Hidden
HTTP	GET/POST parameters
FTP	Username/password
DNS	Subdomain exfiltration
TCP	Raw payload
ICMP	Encoded data
ARP	Rare but possible
4️⃣ Key Wireshark Techniques for CTF
🔎 A. Follow TCP Stream (Most Important)

Right-click a packet →
Follow → TCP Stream

This reconstructs full conversation.

Look for:

flag{something_here}


Or:

Base64 strings

Encoded text

Suspicious commands

🔎 B. Apply Display Filters

Very important for speed.

Common filters:

http
ftp
dns
tcp
udp
icmp


To find text inside packets:

frame contains "flag"


Or:

tcp contains "flag"

🔎 C. Search Function

Ctrl + F

Search:

String

Packet details

Packet bytes

Try searching:

flag
ctf
key
password

🔎 D. Extract Objects (HTTP)

If HTTP traffic exists:

File → Export Objects → HTTP

You can extract:

Images

Files

Text files

Hidden files

Sometimes flag is inside a downloaded file.

5️⃣ Typical Real CTF Scenarios
🟢 Scenario 1: HTTP Basic Auth
4

Filter:

http


Look for:

Authorization: Basic xxxxxxxxx


That string is Base64 encoded.

Decode it.

You may get:

admin:flag{hidden_flag}

🟢 Scenario 2: DNS Exfiltration

Attacker encodes flag inside subdomains.

Filter:

dns


Look at:

abc123.flagpart1.example.com
def456.flagpart2.example.com


Combine parts → decode.

🟢 Scenario 3: Raw TCP Data

Filter:

tcp


Right-click → Follow TCP stream.

You may see:

Hex dump

Encoded blob

Copy → decode in:

CyberChef

Base64 decoder

XOR brute force

🟢 Scenario 4: FTP Credentials

Filter:

ftp


Look for:

USER
PASS


Sometimes:

PASS flag{ftp_flag}

6️⃣ Advanced Filtering Tricks

Find packets with suspicious large data:

tcp.len > 100


Find specific IP:

ip.addr == 192.168.1.10


Find file transfers:

http.response.code == 200

7️⃣ Encoding Awareness (Very Important)

Flags are often:

Base64

Hex

ROT13

XOR encrypted

Gzip compressed

If you see something like:

ZmxhZ3t0ZXN0X2ZsYWd9


That is Base64 → decode.

8️⃣ Professional Workflow (What Good CTF Players Do)

Open PCAP

Check Protocol Hierarchy

Identify dominant protocol

Filter by that protocol

Follow streams

Extract objects

Decode suspicious data

Reassemble fragmented traffic

9️⃣ Pro-Level Tip (Time Saver)

Instead of clicking manually:

Use display filters smartly:

frame contains "flag"


If nothing:
Search for:

frame matches "[A-Za-z0-9+/=]{20,}"


(This finds Base64-like patterns.)

🔟 Tools Used Along With Wireshark

CyberChef

tshark (CLI version of Wireshark)

binwalk

strings (Linux command)

Example:

strings challenge.pcap | grep flag


Sometimes faster than GUI.

⚠️ Important CTF Mindset

CTF network challenges are usually:

Not deeply encrypted

Intentionally solvable

Flag is either:

Clearly visible

Lightly encoded

Hidden in plain sight

Don’t overthink initially.
